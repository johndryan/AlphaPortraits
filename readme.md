# PortraitBot

Hacking together [BaristaBot](http://github.com/kylemcdonald/BaristaBot) and [Kritzler](https://github.com/tinkerlog/Kritzler) to make a bot that draws your portrait with a wall plotter.

It's built with [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) and makes use of the following addons:

* [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv)
* [ofxControlPanel](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxControlPanel)

## CoherentLinePlanning

This app demonstrates how to extract a collection of paths (`vector<ofPolyline>`) from a webcam image in real time (every time you hit the space bar) using coherent line drawing with thresholding and morphological thinning, followed by a slow technique for extracting connected components in a way that focuses on longer paths.

Play a bit with the parameters for controlling coherent line drawing: black, sigma1, sigma2, tau, halfw, smoothPasses. Once you get these set up for a given lighting environment they should be fairly fixed and not require any tweaking for different people.

The thresh setting is post-CLD but is an important number to tweak before the results are thinned. After thinning, a collection of paths is generated using the minGapLength and minPathLength. minGapLength determines how big a jump is between two pixels before it's considered a "gap" (i.e., two disconnected lines). minPathLength determines how many pixels a path must contain in order to be included in the final collection. This helps remove very short paths (noise).

### Black 
* tries to threshold somehow, maybe prethreshold

### Sigmas 
* level of detail, freq of image
* if both low, super detailed and jittery data
* if sigma2 or both high, all features will be swirly lower freq
* both high yields thick lines, most dominant edges; also ghost lines

### Tau
* kind of related to high pass HDR look
* value of 1 (high) will create edges everwhere it can imaging

###Thresh
* high thresh gives more lines (more black), low gives less

###Halfw
* some measure of local vs. global complexity
* low gives lots of swirls, high gives longer lines

###Smoothpasses
* tries to make contours smoother, low number is sharper


## StepperTest

This app is based on firmataExample. It's modified to control a stepper motor via arduino and the EasyShield stepper driver. 

## ArduinoCode

Contains Arduino firmware, currently this is just Standard Firmata
